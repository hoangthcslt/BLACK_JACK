  3. Select the blackjack-main folder you just extracted and create project.
  
  4. JavaFX SDK is needed, follow these steps: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html
  
        - after downloading the SDK, skip "Create a new project" and proceed straight to "Add the JavaFX library" 
       
        - for the "Add VM options", try to Run the app.java file (to failure) once first.
